migrations play a crucial role in managing database schema changes. Here's a summary of the points you mentioned:

1. **Creating Migrations**: To create migrations in Django based on changes in your models, you use the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```
   This command analyzes your models and generates new migration files that represent the changes in the database schema.

2. **Applying Migrations**: After creating migrations, you apply them to the database using the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   This command executes the migration files in the correct order, updating the database schema accordingly.

3. **Default Database**: Django uses SQLite as the default database when you first create a project. However, you can configure other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle by changing the `DATABASES` setting in the `settings.py` file.

4. **SQLite Extension**: To inspect the SQLite database, you can install an SQLite extension that provides a graphical interface to explore the database. You can do this with the help of the `sqlite` package.

5. **Django Migration Folder**: In the SQLite Explorer, you can find the `django_migrations` table that keeps track of the applied migrations for each app.

6. **Inspecting Specific Migration**: You can inspect the SQL statements generated by a specific migration without applying it using the `sqlmigrate` command. For example:
   ```
   python manage.py sqlmigrate store 0003
   ```
   This will show you the SQL commands that would be executed if you applied the migration named `0003` of the app `store`.

Django's migration system is powerful and simplifies the process of managing database schema changes throughout the development and deployment of your project. It helps you keep your database in sync with the changes in your models and ensures data integrity during the migration process.
