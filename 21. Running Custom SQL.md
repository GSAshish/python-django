how to create an empty migration in Django and use the `migrations.RunSQL` operation to insert data into the database and revert the changes back. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Create Empty Migration**: To create an empty migration, use the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations store --empty
   ```
   This command generates an empty migration file in the `store` app.

2. **Fill Operations in the Migration**: In the generated migration file, you can add custom operations using the `migrations.RunSQL` operation. In this example, the migration inserts a row into the `store_collection` table with the title "collection1".

   ```python
   # Generated by Django 4.2.3 on 2023-07-15 16:30
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):
       dependencies = [
           ('store', '0001_initial'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL("""
           INSERT INTO store_collection (title)
           VALUES ('collection1')
           """, """
           DELETE FROM store_collection
           WHERE title='collection1'
           """)
       ]
   ```

3. **Apply Migration**: To apply the migration and execute the custom SQL statements, run the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   This command will create the necessary database table and insert the row with the title "collection1" into the `store_collection` table.

4. **Revert the Migration**: If you want to revert the changes made by the migration, you can run the following command, specifying the app name and the migration name:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate store 0001
   ```
   The above command will undo the changes made by the migration, including the deletion of the row with the title "collection1" from the `store_collection` table.

5. **Delete the Migration File**: After testing the migration and confirming that it works as expected, you can delete the migration file. This is optional and not required for the migration to function correctly. Deleting the migration file helps to keep the migrations directory tidy and avoids confusion when managing migrations in the future.

Remember that migrations in Django are versioned, and each migration file represents a set of changes to the database schema. The `migrate` command tracks which migrations have been applied to the database, allowing you to revert or apply specific changes to the schema easily.
