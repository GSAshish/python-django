a website usually have a FrontEnd and Backend

		FrontEnd                                       Backend
	  is what a Client Sees                     is part which have server 
	                                                                                   buissness logic 

- when someone type our url it sends request to server and server take request and sends response  HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol.

- backend Can generate requested page and then send it back.

- return data and then send it to client and client uses and deploys it.

- second approach is industry best practice sending data.

- you can give end points to get data. in simple words it provide api that we use.


# Overall details about Web development
The web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources that are accessed over the Internet. It allows users to navigate and retrieve information from websites using web browsers. Here's a high-level overview of how the web works:

1. Client-Server Architecture: The web follows a client-server architecture. The client, typically a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, requests information from a server, which stores and delivers the requested resources.

2. Uniform Resource Locator (URL): Each resource on the web, such as a webpage, image, or document, is identified by a unique address called a URL. A URL consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., example.com), and a specific path to the resource.

3. HTTP(S) Protocol: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how clients and servers communicate with each other. The secure version, HTTPS, adds an extra layer of encryption to protect the data transmitted between the client and the server.

4. Request-Response Cycle: When a user enters a URL or clicks on a link, the web browser sends an HTTP request to the server specified in the URL. The request includes information such as the requested resource and additional headers. The server processes the request and generates an HTTP response, which contains the requested resource and status information.

5. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Web pages are typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which defines the structure and content of a webpage. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

6. Rendering: Once the browser receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the server, it interprets and renders them to display the web page to the user. The browser reads the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM) tree, applies CSS styles to the elements, and executes JavaScript code to handle dynamic content and user interactions.

7. Hyperlinks: Hyperlinks are a fundamental aspect of the web. They allow users to navigate between different web pages by clicking on text, images, or buttons that are linked to other URLs. When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser sends a new request to the server, and the process repeats.

8. Web Servers and Hosting: Web servers store and deliver web resources to clients upon request. Websites are hosted on web servers, which can be physical machines or cloud-based services. When a user accesses a website, the browser communicates with the server hosting the website to retrieve the necessary files.

9. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs are distributed networks of servers located in different geographic regions. They help deliver web content more efficiently by caching and serving static resources from servers closest to the user's location. This improves page load times and reduces the load on the origin server.

10. Web Standards and Technologies: The web operates based on various standards and technologies developed by organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These standards define protocols, formats, and guidelines that ensure compatibility and interoperability across different web platforms and browsers.

This overview provides a simplified explanation of how the web works. The actual implementation details can be more complex, involving databases, server-side scripting, APIs, and other technologies, depending on the specific requirements of a website or web application.
