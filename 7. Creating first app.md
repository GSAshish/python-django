Each Django project give certain functionality

every application have this
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions', # now we don't we sessions 
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

In Django, the `startapp` and `startproject` commands serve different purposes:

1. `startproject` Command:
   - Usage: `django-admin startproject <project_name>`
   - The `startproject` command is used to create a new Django project. It initializes the project's directory structure and creates the necessary files to get started.
   - When you run `startproject`, it generates a project-level directory containing the project's settings, URL configuration, and other project-specific files.
   - This command is typically executed once per project.

2. `startapp` Command:
   - Usage: `python manage.py startapp <app_name>`
   - The `startapp` command is used to create a new Django app within a project. An app represents a specific functionality or component of a Django project.
   - When you run `startapp`, it creates an app-level directory that contains files for models, views, templates, and other app-specific components.
   - Apps can be reusable and can be shared across different Django projects.
   - You can create multiple apps within a single Django project to modularize and organize your code.

In summary, the `startproject` command is used to create a new Django project, while the `startapp` command is used to create a new app within an existing Django project. The `startproject` command sets up the project-level structure and files, whereas the `startapp` command creates the app-level structure and files for specific functionality within the project.

write `python manage.py startapp playground`

then add it to 
settings.py
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    "playground"

]
```


Certainly! In Django, following the naming conventions helps maintain consistency and clarity throughout the project. Here's a list of files and their recommended names in Django:

1. URL Configuration:
   - File: `urls.py`
   - Description: This file contains the URL patterns and their corresponding views or viewsets.

2. Views: (should be called action controller)
   - File: `views.py`
   - Description: This file defines the view functions or classes that handle requests and generate responses.

3. Models:
   - File: `models.py`
   - Description: This file defines the data models or database schemas using Django's ORM.

4. Templates:
   - Directory: `templates/`
   - Description: This directory contains HTML templates used for rendering dynamic content.

5. Forms (optional):
   - File: `forms.py`
   - Description: This file defines form classes that handle user input validation and data submission.

Following these naming conventions not only helps in maintaining consistency but also makes it easier for other developers to understand the project structure and locate specific files. However, it's important to note that these naming conventions are not strict requirements, and you have the flexibility to choose different names as per your project's needs.



# Defining view (controller)

```
from django.shortcuts import render

from django.http import HttpResponse

def say_hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World")
```

# Mapping Url in django

create directory in app called urls

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("hello/", views.say_hello)
]
```

In project urls.js file you can add
```python
"""
URL configuration for storefront project.

  
The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/http/urls/

Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
  
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
   
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

"""

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("playground/", include("playground.urls"))
]
```
