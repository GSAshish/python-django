Folder Structure:
storefront/                  # Project root directory
└── storefront/              # Project-specific directory
    ├── __init__.py          # Empty file designating a Python package
    ├── asgi.py              # ASGI configuration for the project
    ├── settings.py.example  # Example settings file (rename to settings.py)

    └── wsgi.py              # WSGI configuration for the project

Steps:
1. Install Python:
   - Download and install Python from the official Python website (python.org).
   - Ensure that the option to add Python to the system's PATH is selected during installation.

2. Verify Python Installation:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command `python --version` to confirm a successful Python installation.

3. Install pipenv:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Execute the command `pip3 install pipenv` to install pipenv for managing virtual environments.

4. Setup VS Code for Python:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Python" in the extensions search bar.
   - Look for the official "Python" extension by Microsoft and click on "Install" to install it.

5. Create a Project Directory and Set Up Virtual Environment:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your project.
   - Run the command `pipenv install django` to create a project directory and install Django in a virtual environment.

6. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, execute `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.

7. Create a Django Project:
   - Run the command `django-admin startproject storefront .` (with a trailing dot) to create a Django project in the current directory.

Folder Structure after Creating the Project:
storefront/                  # Project root directory
├── manage.py                # Django management script
└── storefront/              # Project-specific directory (unchanged)
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py.example   # Example settings file (rename to settings.py)
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py

8. Rename the Example Settings File:
   - Rename the file `settings.py.example` to `settings.py` inside the project-specific directory (`storefront/storefront/`).

9. Run the Django Development Server:
   - `django-admin runserver` will not work because right now doesnot know ssetting.py
   - 
   - In the terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the project root directory (where `manage.py` is located).
   - Execute the command `python manage.py runserver 3010` to start the Django development server on port 3010.
   - Django will recognize the project structure, load the settings from `settings.py`, and start the server.
   - Access the running server by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3010`.
