1. **Monolithic Approach (Not Recommended)**:
   - All functionalities (Products, Customers, Carts, Orders, Tags) are placed in a single app.
   - This results in a large, monolithic codebase that is not reusable and difficult to maintain.
   - Changes to one part of the app may affect others, leading to increased coupling.

2. **Individual Apps for Each Functionality (Not Recommended)**:
   - Each functionality (Products, Customers, Carts, Orders, Tags) is placed in a separate app.
   - There are many links between these apps, leading to confusion and potential issues with interdependencies.
   - Installing and managing multiple apps separately can become cumbersome.
   - Changes in one app may break other apps if they rely heavily on each other.

3. **Separating Core Functionality and Tags (Recommended)**:
   - Place core functionalities (Products, Customers, Carts, Orders) in one app.
   - Place Tags in a separate app since they have a more independent and less tightly coupled nature.
   - Use a many-to-many relationship between `Products` and `Tags` via an intermediary model to maintain the connection between them.
   - This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability while reducing interdependencies.

Explanation (Recommended Approach):
- To create a more maintainable and organized Django project, separate the core functionalities (Products, Customers, Carts, Orders) into one app. This app can be considered the central hub of the project, handling the primary business logic.
- Place Tags in a separate app, as they are relatively independent and can be used across multiple projects without affecting other core functionalities.
- By adopting this approach, you create a better balance between modularity and interdependence. The core functionalities are grouped logically, while Tags remain separate for easier reuse and decoupling.
- The many-to-many relationship between `Products` and `Tags` can be managed through an intermediary model, ensuring the necessary connections between the two.

Benefits of This Approach:
- Improved maintainability: Core functionalities are organized logically, making it easier to manage and understand the codebase.
- Reusability: Tags can be reused across multiple projects, promoting code sharing and reducing duplication.
- Reduced coupling: Separating Tags helps minimize interdependencies between core functionalities, reducing the risk of breaking changes.
- Easier version management: Changes in Tags are less likely to impact other core functionalities, facilitating versioning and updates.

Overall, the recommended approach balances separation of concerns with code reuse, leading to a more modular, maintainable, and scalable Django project.
