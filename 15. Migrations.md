# what is migrations
In the context of backend frameworks, migrations refer to the process of managing changes to the database schema over time. When you develop a web application, you often need to create, modify, or delete database tables, columns, or relationships. Migrations provide a systematic way to handle these changes while preserving existing data and avoiding data loss.

Migrations typically work as follows:

1. **Schema Changes**: When you need to make changes to the database schema, such as adding a new table, modifying an existing table, or adding/removing columns, you create a migration to represent those changes.

2. **Migration Files**: In most backend frameworks, migrations are represented as scripts or files. Each migration file contains code to perform a specific database change, either to create a new database table or modify an existing one.

3. **Versioning**: Migrations are often version-controlled to keep track of the changes made to the database schema over time. The framework ensures that each migration is applied in the correct order to maintain consistency.

4. **Migration Execution**: When you apply migrations, the framework automatically executes the migration files in the correct sequence to update the database schema. This process might involve creating or altering tables, adding or removing columns, or performing other necessary database operations.

5. **Rollbacks**: Most frameworks also support migration rollbacks, which means you can undo a migration if needed. Rollbacks are useful for reverting changes or fixing issues that might arise during development or deployment.

By using migrations, developers can manage the evolution of the database schema without affecting the existing data and without requiring manual intervention in the database management process. It simplifies the process of deploying and maintaining database changes as the application evolves over time.
