Debugging Django applications in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can be done using the built-in debugging capabilities of the editor. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and perform debugging in a Django project:

1. Install the Python Extension:
   - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Python" in the extensions search bar.
   - Look for the official "Python" extension by Microsoft and click on "Install" to install it.

2. Configure the Debugging Environment:
   - Open your Django project in VS Code.
   - Go to the Run and Debug view by clicking on the Run icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+D`.
   - Click on the gear icon to create a new debug configuration.
   - Choose "Python" as the environment.

3. Configure the Debug Configuration:
   - A `.vscode/launch.json` file will be created automatically. This file holds the debug configurations.
   - Update the `"program"` setting to point to the `manage.py` file of your Django project, like this:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "name": "Python: Django",
               "type": "python",
               "request": "launch",
               "program": "${workspaceFolder}/manage.py",
               "args": ["runserver"],
               "django": true
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. Set Breakpoints:
   - Open the file where you want to set breakpoints for debugging.
   - Click in the left gutter (next to the line numbers) to set a breakpoint. A red circle will appear to indicate the breakpoint.

5. Start Debugging:
   - In the Run and Debug view, select "Python: Django" from the drop-down list of debug configurations.
   - Click on the green play button to start the Django development server in debug mode.

6. Trigger the Debugger:
   - Access your Django application in a web browser or using tools like `curl` or Postman.
   - When the code execution hits a breakpoint, the debugging will pause, and you can inspect variables and step through the code.

7. Use Debug Tools:
   - While debugging, you can use the various debugging tools provided by VS Code, such as stepping through code, examining variables, and inspecting the call stack.

Remember to remove or disable breakpoints once you're done debugging. Debugging is an essential tool for identifying and resolving issues in your Django application, and using VS Code's built-in debugger can significantly simplify the process.
