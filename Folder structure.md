PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. It provides guidelines and recommendations for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code. Following PEP 8 helps improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration among developers. Here are some key points from PEP 8:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

2. **Line length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters. If a line needs to be longer, it should be broken into multiple lines using parentheses or backslashes.

3. **Import statements**: Each import statement should be on a separate line. Group imports into three sections: standard library imports, related third-party imports, and local application imports. Sort the imports alphabetically within each section.

4. **Whitespace**: Use a single space around operators and after commas. Avoid extraneous whitespace at the beginning or end of lines.

5. **Naming conventions**: Use lowercase letters and underscores for variable and function names. Use CapitalizedWords (also known as CamelCase) for class names. Use uppercase letters for constants.

6. **Function and method definitions**: Use a space between the function name and the opening parenthesis. Place any arguments or parameters inside the parentheses, separated by commas.

7. **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex code or provide additional context. Place comments on a separate line or use inline comments sparingly. Comments should be clear, concise, and relevant.

8. **Documentation strings (docstrings)**: Use docstrings to document modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings should describe the purpose, behavior, and usage of the code element.

9. **Code layout**: Organize your code with logical structure and spacing. Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
